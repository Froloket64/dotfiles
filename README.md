## Installation
### Dependencies
Normally, they should be taken care of by the installation script (see below), but it's a good idea to install them manually (or if the installation script fails to).
 - `stow`
 - `gum`
 - `python`
 - `jinja-cli` (from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jinja-cli/))
 - `dart-sass` (or other [Sass distribution](https://sass-lang.com/install))[<sup>1</sup>](#notes)

### Supported distros
Currently supported distros[<sup>2</sup>](#notes):
 - Arch Linux _(and -based)_
 - Ubuntu _(and -based)_

To install the packages and deploy the dotfiles just do the following:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Froloket64/dotfiles --depth 1 ~/.dotfiles # Clone the repo
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh # Run the installation script
```

Also, use `./install.sh --help` to see usage and options.

### Other distros
If you're not using one of the supported distros, the operations are the same, except for installation of the packages - you'll have to do that manually. Afterwards, the script can deploy all the dotfiles just fine (note the `-I` flag)

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Froloket64/dotfiles --depth 1 ~/.dotfiles # Clone the repo
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh -I # Deploy without installation
```

Contributions regarding other distro support are **welcome**.

## Metaconfiguration
Yes, there's configuration to this configuration. It consists of a [`settings.json`](/settings.json) file that contains all "settings" to the configuration such as your theme, your monitors, wallpaper and so on. All of that is compiled into plain config files using `jinja` (and symlinked) with `./install.sh -I`.

### Features
In [`settings.json`](/settings.json) there's also a section labeled **"features"**. It provides a way to enable/disable certain additional features that are opinionated/require additional dependencies. To toggle features on and off just set their values to `true` or `false` respectively.

``` diff
    "features": {
-        "swayfx": false,
+        "swayfx": true,
    }
```

Available features are:
 - `swayfx` - Enables features unique to [Swayfx](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx), a fork of Sway
 - `lsSingleLine` - Makes `ls` ouput each file on a separate line (without `ls -l` info)

## Notes
 1. (**NOTE**: If you install a different package, ensure that the `SASS_EXEC` variable in the [`install.sh`](/install.sh) script is set to its path or its name if it's in the [PATH](https://www.howtogeek.com/658904/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path-in-linux/))
 2. But note the package name changes for *N*-based (from above) distros which are not considered by the script.
